these python scripts simplifies your interaction with ffmpeg. FFmpeg is a free and open-source software project consisting of a large suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. It's designed for command-line interface but it's very troublesome to write your options again and again. These python scripts are the solution of your problem related to it. My scripts compresses the media(audio/video) without any visible quality drop. If you want more from these scripts you can just change the codecs I've mentioned.
