# FFmpeg-Compressor-Python

this python script simplifies your interaction with ffmpeg. FFmpeg is a free and open-source software project consisting of a large suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. It's designed for command-line interface but it's very troublesome to write your options again and again. This python script is the solution of your problem related to it. My script compresses the media(audio/video) based on the streams in the media file. If you want more from this script you can just change the codecs I've mentioned in Compressor.py file.
